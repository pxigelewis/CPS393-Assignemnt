# CPS393-Assignment
Bingo Card Linux/Unix Assignment:

User runs LINUX with a Card (basically, a 5x5 matrix of integers).
LINUX "calls" (provides) random numbers one-by-one. Each time a number
is called, if that number appears on the user's Card, it is "marked".
User wins when a row, or column, or all 4 corners, becomes marked.
